# Goal
*My goal of this project was to develop a mouse-controlled robotic arm, using parts that were exclusively 3D printed, that translate real-time mouse movements and button inputs into precise servo motor motions.* 
*This system allows for an intuitive control of the arm using standard computer input.* 

 ## Pre-Setup intstructions
 - You will need an Arduino UNO, Arduino Leonardo, a USB hostshield, 3 Servo Motors, and some jumper cables. 
 - Once you have procured the aforementioned items you will need to solder 1 3.3V pad and 2 5V pads on the hostshield.

   ## Steup instructions
   **Install necessary files and 3D print the CAD files**
   - Download the .ino files and upload them to the respective arduinos
   - Make sure to import "USB Host Shield Library 2.0" in your Arduino IDE
   - 3D print the CAD files and assemble them
   - Install the Servo Motors, using the m.2 screws to screw them into place
   - Some Notes about construction listed in the "CadFiles" Folder
